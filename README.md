### Background: 
To date, most aging studies have been carried out in the laboratory on model species (e.g., mice) as they are easy to house and manipulate. However, bats are a fantastic wild-borne alternative to traditional model-based studies. Despite their small body size, many species of bats have independently evolved long lifespans. The student(s) will assist co-PIs Lama and Davalos in comparatively examining the genomes of short- and long-lived species of bats. Guided by PIs, the student will use (1) candidate gene/pathway approaches (2) top-down and bottom-up methods and (3) unbiased whole genome-wide approaches to explore the evolution of genes and pathways underlying unexpected longevity

…using a candidate gene/pathway approach and also using a whole genome-wide unbiased approach top-down and bottom-up methods. 
The student will uncover regions of the genome under convergent and divergent rapidly-evolving regions of the genome in short- vs. long-lived bats using the state of the art comparative genomics methods. These days will discover genomic regions under selection in bats, which underlie bats’ longevity and health, and will be the basis for further inquiry. 

Two fully funded summer interns (10 week, $6000… funded by the National Science Foundation) are available to join Drs. Lama and Davalos, and collaborators from May 2021. 




We are seeking 1-2 undergraduate students to join our research team for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) positions in the summer of 2021 (dates to-be-announced). The positions are supported through the National Science Foundation (NSF) and participants will receive a $6000 stipend ($15/h), and will be expected to participate full-time (35-40hr/week). There is no limit on the geographic location of the student, however, due to our funding source, we are limited to individuals who are U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or permanent residents of the United States. Students must be enrolled as undergraduates in Fall 2021. In other words, students who have graduated or are graduating this spring in May 2021 are not eligible for the REU. 

REU students will collaborate with our lab members to complete research projects in comparative genomics. Potential projects center around using genomics as a tool to understand evolution and aging – our team primarily focuses on bats. The only expectation we have for the incoming student-researchers is to have some familiarity with genetics (e.g. an undergraduate genetics course). Students will be mentored as they learn the computational skills (coding on the command line and in R) to analyze molecular data, as well as the communication and data visualization skills to present their findings to colleagues. 

Our research group is committed to maintaining and further developing an equitable and inclusive research environment and we welcome students from all backgrounds to apply. We are seeking passionate, enthusiastic undergraduates to join us for this opportunity – no prior research experience required! 

If interested, please submit this application (https://forms.gle/2P7w6UexDnXkY9bc6) by March 12th, 2021. Feel free to email the principal investigator (PI) at the head of this recruitment, Dr. Tanya Lama (tanya.lama@stonybrook.edu) with any questions. Please do not contact Dr. Davalos regarding these positions.
